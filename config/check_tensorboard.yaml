# TensorBoard test config
# Fast test with only the two fastest samplers (MCLMC and VI)
# VI has TensorBoard enabled for monitoring
#
# Usage:
#   uv run lambda-hat workflow sample --config config/check_tensorboard.yaml --backend local
#
# Purpose: Quick test to verify TensorBoard logging works for VI
