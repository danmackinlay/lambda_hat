# Optuna hyperparameter optimization demo config
#
# This config defines problems for Optuna to optimize hyperparameters against.
# Each problem gets an HMC reference, then methods are optimized to match it.

# Problem specifications (similar to targets in experiments.yaml)
problems:
  # Small test problem for quick iteration
  - model: small          # Model config from lambda_hat/conf/model/small.yaml
    data: base            # Data config from lambda_hat/conf/data/base.yaml
    teacher: _null        # No teacher (null synthetic)
    seed: 42

  # Additional problems can be added here for multi-problem optimization
  # - model: base
  #   data: base
  #   teacher: _null
  #   seed: 43

# Methods to optimize (currently supports: sgld, vi, mclmc)
methods:
  - vi                    # Start with VI only for testing
  # - sgld                # Uncomment to add SGLD
  # - mclmc               # Uncomment to add MCLMC

# Optuna configuration (optional, can override via CLI)
optuna:
  max_trials: 50          # Max trials per (problem, method) - reduced for demo
  batch_size: 8           # Concurrent trials - reduced for local testing
  hmc_budget_sec: 3600    # 1 hour for HMC reference (reduced for demo)
  method_budget_sec: 600  # 10 minutes per trial (reduced for demo)
